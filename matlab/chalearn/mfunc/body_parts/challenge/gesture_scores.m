% function result = gesture_scores(model, observed)
%
% model is a motion sequence used as training data, and corresponding 
% to a specific gesture, and with
% normalized number of frames, rows, cols
% 
% observed is the motion extracted from an input video sequence, 
% where we want to do gesture spotting. The number of frames is NOT
% normalized, but the number of rows and cols is normalized.
